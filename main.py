# RUN: from main import *
# Then run help(whatever)
# Then run whatever

# Example:
#   >>>from main import *
#   >>>???

# To do:
# 1. Create an exam jupyter notebook
#
# 2.1 Create a numeric plotter for flow curves
# 2.2 Create a numeric plotter for the deformation of lines by a vector field
# 2.3 Create a numeric plotter for the deformation of surfaces by a vector field
# 2.4 Create a numeric plotter for the deformation of solids by a vector field
#
# 3. Create explanations (verbose=True) for all functions
#
# 4. Automatically create parametrization of a surface 
#   4.1 given points in some plane
#   4.2 given description like 'sphere'
#   4.3 given parametrization of solid (then the surface is the rim/edge of the solid)
